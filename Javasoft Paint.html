		Changelog
		15/10/2018 Template released, the basic template was tested - mouse tracking is partially complete, colour selection is partially complete
		19/10/2018 Changed canvas size to 700 x 700, modified colours so that they paint in the corresponding colours, added brown, black, dark green and sky blue colours to tool kit.
		20/10/2018 Added an erase feature and modified the reset button so that it changes the canvas colour to the currently selected colour.
		21/10/2018 Added 4 buttons for controling brush size, one for default and 3 others for larger sizes. Also added an element where the brush size is printed for the user.
		24/10/2018 Modified the colour selector so that it no longer relys on a submit button to get the colour chosen. Modified colour buttons so that they are circular.
		25/10/2018 Added a function that sets the background colour to black on currently selected colour, all other buttons remain the default border colour (white)
		27/10/2018 Styled the page so that the background is pale blue and the canvas has a black border
		5/11/2018 fixed the offset so that it scales to the current brush size

		
		Suggested Tasks:
		1. Take time to fully review and become familiar with this template and ensure it works (in the sense that there are no errors).
		2. Fully read the assignment brief - it contains all the requirements and details you need to design, test and implement
		3. After each development cycle (e.g. any time spent programming - this could be an hour to several hours) you are expected to add a changelog entry; each entry should include the date followed by a single sentence that describes what has been changed, updated, added, fixed etc (Please note this is a CORE expectation and requirements, get in to the habit of added them as you go!)
		4. After you have implemented a requirement (there are 11 in total; these are described in sections 2 & 3 of the Marks Awarded section of the assignment brief) conduct and document a test to check whether the implemented requirement works as expected and as needed.  Record these tests in the test log section located and the bottom of this page.
		5. You are not allowed to remove any code already provided but you can expand and further develop it
			5a. Any new functions must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. fnPaint should be fnPaint_MW)
			5b. Any new variables must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. iMouseX the initial "i" to indicate it will hold an integer value or sColour to indicate a string value)
			5c. Change the name of this template so that YOUR ACTUAL student id replaces the word "studentid" in the filename
		6. Work to complete the various requirements - start with the simplest,
			6a. Review and work out how to set the canvas to a more appropriate size (e.g. 800 pixels wide and tall)
			6b.	Extend the functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three
			6c. Expand the fnClearCanvas function so that it actually works
			6d. Work out how to enhance the clear canvas function so that it resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour;
				dont forget to update the important variables (e.g. sCanvasColour)
			6e. Extend the colour selection tools so that there are eight working tools
			6f. Design some method to indicate which colour is active; this should automatically change as soon as a new colour is selected
			6g. This template includes some interested opportunities to explore holding down the control, alt and shift keys while moving the mouse;
				see if you can somehow use these examples to add implement any of the requirements (e.g. erase mode, brush size, etc.) - remember,
				don't try to solve the whole thing in a single instance, build it up little by little, keep copies of your work so if everything breaks
				you can also return to a working version and try again

		Critical note:
			Please ensure that you maintain and use the expected programming standards outlined in the brief in the Marks Awarded section 4.1 to 4.5 (Programming Standards and Documentation) - especially the use of the REQUIRED function and variable naming convention /

			You will be expected to maintain, program and submit neat code that fully supports appropriate indentation and comments - don't forget failure to maintain standards will result in a significant penalty.

		Good luck, before we leave you to get on with this - remember, by completing the tutorial sessions and practicalâ€™s all this should (at least) be familiar; complete the tutorials before attempting to program this system.

		Test Log
		*****************************************************************************************
		Test Date, Use & Operatins No (1-6), Description, What did you test, Results, Reflections
		*****************************************************************************************
		5/11/2018, 1 : Paint Mode, leaves a trail of paint in the selected colour when the user depresses the left mouse button, this trail starts from the middle of the crosshair and is based on the currently selected brush size, Tested whether the paint tool paints from the centre of crosshair and in the colour selected and whether the brush size affects the offset, Result : Paint tool paints from the centre of the crosshair on the default brush size (10px), however on larger brush sizes it appears to paint slightly off centre, changing the colour also changes the paint colour. PASSED Reflections: Everything but the offset works as intended, offset only fails to work as intended when the brush size is increased to sizes larger than the default size which could cause some small annoyance to the end user.
		
		5/11/2018 2: Erase Mode, removes existing paint from the canvas when the user depresses the left mouse button, must erase from the centre of the crosshair and be affected by the currently selected brush size, tested whether the erase tool removes paint from the canvas and if changing the brush size has any effect on the size of the eraser. Result: The erase tool removes paint on the canvas by paint the colour white over it, when the brush size is changes so is the size of the eraser, the erase tool erases from the centre of the crosshair however has the same problem with offset at larger brush sizes as the paint tool. PASSED Reflections: The erase tool works as intended as it removes paint from the canvas, however changing the brush size can cause the offset of the tool to appear strange (like the paint tool).
		
		6/11/18 3: Brush Size tools, 4 buttons that allow the brush size to be changed, Tested whether each of the 4 buttons changed the brush size to the determined size and if changing the brush size also changed the value displayed next to where it says "Brush Size", Result: Clicking the default button changed the brush size to 10px and also changed the value next to "brush size" to 10, clicking the big button changed the brush size to 20px and the value displayed to 20" clicking the bigger button changed the brush size to 30px and the value displayed to 30 clicking the Biggest button changed the brush size to 50px and the value displayed to 50 PASSED Reflections: All the buttons work as intended and the value displayed also changes when the brush size is changed.
